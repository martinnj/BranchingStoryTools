===================

A project I'm doing for fun, learning C#/XML interaction and usage. Also, just getting familiar with C#.
Don't want to put too much crappy code in the FEngine project. :)

Flankers BST/XML Format
-----------------------

So I'll try to document the XML format, I don't expect anyone to use it, but it's good practice for me,
and it might prevent me from forgetting it, and maybe learn how to use markdown. Sounds good enough for me.
So lets get started!

So like every XML document we need the pesky standard header.

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
```

The root element in the format is simply called ```XML <forest>```
